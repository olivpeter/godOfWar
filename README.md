# God of War Ragnar√∂k | Landing Page

![banner](./github/share-og.jpg)

This repository contains the project built from scratch as part of a Front-end event Dev Process by [CodeBoost](https://www.youtube.com/@codeboostDev). During the sessions, we dive into creating a God of War Landing Page, step by step, mastering essential web development skills using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
